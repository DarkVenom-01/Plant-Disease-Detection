# Plant Disease Detection Website 🌿

This project is a web-based application that uses advanced image analysis and machine learning techniques to detect plant diseases by analyzing leaf images. It is designed to help farmers, researchers, and agricultural professionals identify plant diseases quickly and take preventive measures.

---

## Features 🎯
- **Disease Detection**: Upload a leaf image to identify potential plant diseases.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive design for seamless user interaction.
- **Disease Information**: Provides details about the disease, symptoms, and preventive measures.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

---

## Technology Stack 🛠️

### Frontend:
- **HTML5**: Page structure and semantic elements.
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic interactions and validations.

### Backend:
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for disease prediction.

### Database (will be implemented later):
- **MySQL** or **SQLite**: For storing user data and disease information.

## How It Works ⚙️

1. **Upload an Image**: The user uploads a clear image of the plant leaf.
2. **Preprocessing**: The system preprocesses the image (resizing, noise reduction, etc.).
3. **Prediction**: The trained machine learning model analyzes the image and predicts the disease.
4. **Results Displayed**: The website shows the disease name with confidence.

## Dataset 📊
The model was trained using a publicly available dataset of plant leaves with labeled diseases. Ensure that the dataset is included in the appropriate folder before training.

---

## Future Enhancements 🚀
- Add support for additional plant species and diseases.
- Integrate a mobile application for real-time detection.
- Provide multi-language support for global accessibility.
- Improve the accuracy of the machine learning model with a larger dataset.
